The lesson I mainly learned doing this Assessment are two fold.

1) I have been programing in C++ and C# for many years but I have basicallly only took a single class in the C programing language
and so I was able to brush the rust off my C Language skills.

2) I was able to learn more about radar coordinates and GIS coordinates and the equation between them.
